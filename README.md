# Lotto-Luck

## Overview
This is a program that collects scratch off ticket data from the Ohio Lottery website. 
The available attributes for each ticket are the name, game number, price, odds of winning, 
prizes remaining, picture link, and the time collected. After all tickets are scraped, 
the data is inserted into a MySQL database.
